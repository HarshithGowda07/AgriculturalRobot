# Solar Powered Agricultural Bot using Arduino

## Introduction
The Solar Powered Agricultural Bot is an autonomous robot designed to automate tasks like irrigation, fertilization, and pesticide spraying in agricultural fields. It uses an Arduino microcontroller, various sensors, and solar power to perform these tasks efficiently.

## Objective
The bot aims to:
1. Automate irrigation using a soil moisture sensor.
2. Automate fertilization using an NPK sensor.
3. Automate pesticide spraying using a pump and solenoid valve.
4. Follow a predefined path using IR sensors.
5. Detect rain and return to its initial position.
6. Use solar energy for power.

## Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- L298N Motor Driver
- DC Motors
- IR Sensors
- Plant Detection Sensor
- Soil Moisture Sensor
- Rain Sensor
- NPK Sensor
- Solenoid Valves
- Pump and Solenoid Valve
- Solar Panel
- Battery
- Relay Module

## Working Principle
The bot uses IR sensors to follow a line, detects plants using a plant sensor, and performs tasks like irrigation, fertilization, and pesticide spraying based on sensor inputs. It stops all operations and returns to its initial position if rain is detected.

## Future Enhancements
1. Obstacle avoidance using ultrasonic sensors.
2. Remote monitoring using IoT.
3. Advanced sensors for better crop management.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the potential of robotics and automation in modernizing agriculture and improving food production.
